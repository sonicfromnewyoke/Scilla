# **Scilla — An Interactive Solana CLI**

**Scilla** is a fast, developer-friendly interactive command-line interface for Solana.
Instead of manually typing long CLI flags, Scilla uses intelligent prompting to help you build and execute commands seamlessly — making the workflow far less tedious.

With Scilla, you can easily **inspect on-chain data**, **query cluster state**, **send transactions**, and perform a wide range of Solana development and debugging tasks — all from a unified interactive shell.
